== Description ==

The <a href="http://dp.la">DPLA</a> has lots of cool content, and WP DPLA is a way to help your readers discover and explore that content. It takes the tags you’ve assigned to your post – say, cheesehead and Packers or pizza, beer, and nachos – and fetches four random items from DPLA’s partner collections, and displays them at the bottom of the post.

This plugin was originally developed for the Maker Challenge at <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/">THATCamp CHNM 2013</a> (which it won!). Read the <a href="http://chnm2013.thatcamp.org/06/08/maker-challenge-wordpress-plugin-for-displaying-related-items-from-the-dpla/">THATCamp post</a> for more details on how the plugin works.
